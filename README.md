Very simple and bare bones react-redux-saga app that uses digitraffic API: https://www.digitraffic.fi/rautatieliikenne/#rajapinnat.
Quick showcase how I would construct a react project. Done in a hurry so stuff like tests are missing.

´npm install´ to install dependencies.
´npm start´ to run it.
´npm build´ to build.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
